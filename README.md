# R_assignment_BP: Contents

## RAssignment_Beatriz.Rmd : Contains the code and description used for data inspection, processing, and visualization. Please note that you do not have to download the fang_et_al_genotypes or snp_position.txt files, since we are pulling them from github. Also, note that running all commands will generate new files and figures. 

## Decreasing_Maize: 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: -, for maize sample. 

## Incresing_Maize: 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: ?, for maize sample. 

## Decreasing_Teosinte: 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: -, for teosinte sample.

## Increasing_Teosinte: 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values and with missing data encoded by this symbol: ?, for teosinte sample.
